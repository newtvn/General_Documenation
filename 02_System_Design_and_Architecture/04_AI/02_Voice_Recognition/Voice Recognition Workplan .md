## **Step 1: Data Acquisition**  **Use the Issue to close**  [**https://github.com/users/openchlai/projects/2/views/3?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=wanyamabitz\&pane=issue\&itemId=93069590\&issue=openchlai%7CGeneral\_Documenation%7C12**](https://github.com/users/openchlai/projects/2/views/3?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=wanyamabitz&pane=issue&itemId=93069590&issue=openchlai%7CGeneral_Documenation%7C12)

### **Objective:**

Collect and preprocess a small sample dataset (10 cases and audios) for initial model training and evaluation, following the data pipeline processes.

### **Procedure:**

#### **Data Sources:**

* Start by selecting a small sample of 10 cases and associated audio files. The data sources will be sourced from:  
  * **Voice Data:** Audio files uploaded by users or extracted from the demo helpline system.  
  * **Existing Text Records:** Historical case records for training the case prediction model, extracted from databases.  
* All sources must be validated for quality, relevance, and legal compliance.

#### **Text Data Collection:**

* **Clean and Normalize:** Text data will be cleaned and normalized according to the preprocessing steps outlined in the pipeline (e.g., removing irrelevant text, standardizing case).

#### **Tokenization:**

##### **Manual Tokenization**

1. Identify Token Boundaries: Carefully read the text and mark the beginning and end of each word or meaningful unit (token).  
2. Create a Token List: Maintain the sequence of tokens in a structured format.  
3. Annotation (Optional): Add part-of-speech or lemma annotations if necessary.  
   

##### **Automated Tokenization**

1. **Select a Tokenization Algorithm:** Choose an algorithm suitable for the language and task (You will document).  
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize the text by removing unwanted characters, handling special cases, and converting to lowercase ().  
3. **Apply Algorithm:** Run the selected tokenization algorithm on the text.  
4. **Post-processing:** Refine the output to ensure consistency and correctness.

##### **Documentation**

* **Tokenization Rules:** Guidelines for identifying token boundaries and handling special cases.  
* **Algorithm Description:** Detailed documentation of the chosen algorithm and its parameters.  
* **Preprocessing & Post-processing:** Steps taken before and after tokenization.  
* **Token List Format:** Define the format for storing tokens and any additional annotations.

#### **Audio Data Collection:**

* **Voice Data Collection:** Gather audio files through the helpline system or user uploads as part of batch or streaming ingestion in the data pipeline.  
* **Segment Audio:** Break down audio into smaller clips if necessary.  
* **Noise Reduction and Standardization:** Apply preprocessing techniques to ensure high-quality input.  
* **Storage:** Save raw audio files to cloud storage/ or onPrem Server (CI/CD to verify).

#### **Documentation:**

* Record data sources, acquisition methods, and storage locations.  
* Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations(We will work on compliance.  
* Document metadata (e.g., file ID, timestamp, speaker details).

### **Deliverables:**

* **Data Acquisition Report:** Sources, methods, and compliance.  
* **Initial Raw Data:** Stored on on-prem infrastructure.

### **Milestone:**

✅ **Completion of Initial Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

## **Step 2: Model Selection and Preparation**

### **Objective:**

### **Procedure:**

* **Prepare Data Subsets:** Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.  
* **Define Training Parameters:** Set hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).  
* **Conduct Training:** Monitor loss and adjust parameters.  
* **Evaluate Performance:** Test the model on validation data.
