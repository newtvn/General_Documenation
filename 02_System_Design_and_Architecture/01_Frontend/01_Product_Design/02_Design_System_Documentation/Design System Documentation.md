## Project Name: OpenCHS Design System
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 19th March 2025

## 1. Introduction
This directory houses the comprehensive documentation for our design system, establishing the foundation for consistent visual and interactive experiences across the project.

### 1.1 Purpose
To maintain and document the design systemâ€™s core elements, ensuring consistency and efficiency in design implementation across all platforms and products.

## 2. Key Contents
- **Color Palettes and Usage Guidelines:** Defined primary, secondary, and accent colors with appropriate use cases.
- **Typography System and Hierarchy:** Font families, sizes, weights, and use-case guidelines.
- **Spacing and Layout Principles:** Grid structures, margins, paddings, and alignment rules.
- **Design Tokens and Their Applications:** Standardized variables for colors, typography, spacing, and components.
- **Grid Systems and Breakpoints:** Responsive grid definitions and viewport-specific breakpoints.
- **Animation and Motion Guidelines:** Guidelines for transitions, hover effects, and microinteractions.

## 3. Guidelines
- **Keep all design tokens updated and synchronized.**
- **Document any modifications to the design system.**
- **Include examples of proper usage.**
- **Maintain compatibility notes for different platforms.**
- **Reference any tools or integrations used.**

## 4. Visual Identity
### 4.1 Branding & Style
- **Logo & Imagery:** Guidelines for logo placement, image selection, and branding consistency.
- **Tone & Voice:** Ensuring a neutral, professional, and informative brand tone.
- **Iconography:** Consistent styling and usage across UI elements.

### 4.2 Color System
- **Primary Colors:** Used for main UI elements and branding.
- **Secondary Colors:** Supporting elements for contrast and highlights.
- **Accent Colors:** Used for warnings, alerts, and call-to-action buttons.
- **Contrast Compliance:** Ensuring WCAG AA/AAA accessibility standards are met.

### 4.3 Typography
- **Primary Font:** Open Sans (or equivalent modern sans-serif font for readability).
- **Font Weights:** Regular, Medium, Bold for structured hierarchy.
- **Text Sizes:** Defined text sizes for headings, paragraphs, and labels.

### 4.4 Grid & Layout
- **Grid System:** Based on a **12-column responsive grid**.
- **Spacing Scale:** Modular scale for consistent padding, margins, and component gaps.
- **Breakpoints:** Mobile-first responsive design with predefined viewport sizes.

## 5. UI Components
### 5.1 Component Library
- **Buttons:** Primary, secondary, and disabled states.
- **Forms & Inputs:** Input fields, dropdowns, and validation messages.
- **Cards & Containers:** Structured layouts with elevation and spacing rules.
- **Modals & Overlays:** Lightboxes and full-screen dialogs.
- **Navigation Elements:** Sidebars, top bars, and bottom navigation patterns.
- **Tables & Data Display:** List views, tabular layouts, and data grids.

### 5.2 Interaction Patterns
- **Navigation:** Consistent placement of menus and wayfinding elements.
- **Feedback & Alerts:** Success, error, and warning messages with inline validation.
- **Microinteractions:** Hover states, transitions, and loading indicators.

## 6. Accessibility & Compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all elements are keyboard accessible.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML.
- **Color Contrast:** WCAG compliance for readability.
- **Alternative Input Methods:** Support for voice, touch, and other input forms.

## 7. Design Tokens & System Updates
- **Color Variables:** Standardized HEX/RGB values for brand colors.
- **Typography Tokens:** Font families, weights, and letter spacing guidelines.
- **Spacing & Layout Tokens:** Defined sizes for margins and paddings.
- **Component Tokens:** Standard button heights, card paddings, etc.

## 8. Tools & Collaboration
- **Design Repository:** Version-controlled Figma files.
- **Prototyping:** Interactive prototypes for usability testing.
- **Documentation Hub:** Internal knowledge base for design principles.
- **Handoff Process:** Developer-ready UI kits and asset exports.

## 9. Conclusion & Next Steps
- Finalize component libraries for uniform development.
- Conduct accessibility audits for compliance.
- Implement iterative updates based on user feedback.

This document will evolve with continuous improvements to the OpenCHS design system.
