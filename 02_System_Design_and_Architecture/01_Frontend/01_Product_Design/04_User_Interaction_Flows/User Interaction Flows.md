## 1. Introduction

The OpenCHS User Interaction Flows documentation provides comprehensive guidance on how users navigate through the application. This document serves as the authoritative reference for understanding, designing, and implementing consistent user experiences across all OpenCHS interfaces.

User flows are critical to ensuring that the application meets user needs efficiently while maintaining consistency with our design principles and accessibility standards.

---

## 2. Purpose & Principles

### Purpose
To document and maintain clear representations of user journeys and interaction patterns, ensuring:
- **Consistency** in navigation patterns across the application
- **Intuitiveness** in how users accomplish tasks
- **Efficiency** in user task completion
- **Clarity** in application behavior and feedback
- **Predictability** in system responses to user actions

### Core Principles
1. **User-Centered Design**: Flows prioritize user needs and goals over system architecture
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information and options are revealed at appropriate moments
3. **Error Prevention**: Flows are designed to minimize user errors
4. **Clear Feedback**: Each action has a visible and understandable system response
5. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should always know where they are and how to proceed

---

## 3. User Journey Documentation

### 3.1 User Journey Maps

User journey maps document the end-to-end experience of users completing specific goals within the system, accounting for emotions, pain points, and opportunities.

#### Components
- **User personas**: Who is experiencing the journey
- **Scenario**: The specific situation being mapped
- **Journey stages**: Key phases in the experience
- **Actions**: What the user does at each stage
- **Thoughts and emotions**: User's mental and emotional state
- **Pain points**: Frustrations and obstacles encountered
- **Opportunities**: Potential improvements to the experience

#### Documentation Format
User journey maps should be created as:
- Visual diagrams with a clear timeline
- Supporting narrative documentation
- Linked to relevant research insights

#### Example User Journey Map
**Persona**: Dr. Sarah Chen, Primary Care Physician  
**Scenario**: Reviewing a patient's medical history before an appointment

| Stage | Actions | Thoughts/Emotions | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Preparation | Logs into system, searches for patient record | "I need to quickly review this patient's history before they arrive" | System sometimes takes time to load complete history | Implement prioritized loading of recent encounters |
| Review | Scrolls through medical history, clicks on recent lab results | "I need to check if there are any concerning trends" | Too much scrolling required to see full history | Create condensed timeline view with expandable sections |
| Analysis | Makes notes about questions to ask patient | "I should flag these issues to discuss" | No easy way to flag items for discussion | Add ability to mark items for discussion in appointment |
| Decision | Creates mental plan for appointment | Confident about addressing key issues | Difficult to share preparation notes with nursing staff | Enable sharing of pre-appointment notes with care team |

---

### 3.2 Flow Diagrams

Flow diagrams visually map the paths users take through the application to complete specific tasks, illustrating decision points, inputs, and possible outcomes.

#### Types
- **Task flows**: Linear sequences of steps for a specific task
- **System flows**: Complex flows involving multiple paths and conditions
- **Decision trees**: Branching paths based on user choices or system conditions

#### Documentation Requirements
- Start and end points clearly marked
- Decision points with all possible outcomes
- System actions and user actions differentiated
- Error states and recovery paths
- Annotations for complex interactions

#### Example Flow Diagram Structure
```
[Start] → [Search Patient] → [Select Patient] → [Decision: New or Follow-up?]
  ↓                                              ↓
[New Visit Flow]                             [Follow-up Flow]
  ↓                                              ↓
[Document Symptoms] → [Order Tests] → [Prescribe Treatment] → [End]
```

#### Standard Notation
- Rectangles: Process steps or actions
- Diamonds: Decision points
- Arrows: Flow direction
- Dotted lines: Optional paths
- Red elements: Error states or critical paths

---

### 3.3 Interaction Patterns

Standard interaction patterns define consistent ways for users to accomplish common tasks across the application.

#### Core Patterns
- **Data Entry**: Forms, inline editing, auto-completion
- **Data Visualization**: Tables, charts, dashboards
- **Navigation**: Menus, breadcrumbs, tabs, pagination
- **Search & Filter**: Quick search, advanced filters, sorting
- **Feedback**: Notifications, confirmations, error messages
- **User Assistance**: Tooltips, contextual help, wizards

#### Pattern Documentation Format
Each pattern should document:
- **Purpose**: What task or need the pattern addresses
- **Components**: UI elements involved
- **Behavior**: How the pattern responds to interaction
- **Variations**: Adaptations for different contexts
- **Accessibility**: Special considerations for accessibility
- **Examples**: Screenshots or links to implementations

#### Standard Pattern Example: Advanced Search
**Purpose**: Allow users to find specific patient records using multiple criteria  
**Components**: Search field, filter panel, results list  
**Behavior**:
1. User enters initial search term
2. System displays results and available filters
3. User can refine search by selecting filters
4. Results update dynamically as filters are applied
5. User can save search criteria for future use

---

### 3.4 State Transitions

State transition diagrams document how system states change in response to user actions, showing all possible states and the events that trigger transitions between them.

#### Key Elements
- **States**: Distinct conditions of a UI component or screen
- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences
- **Transitions**: Changes from one state to another
- **Actions**: What happens during a transition
- **Guards**: Conditions that must be true for a transition

#### Documentation Format
- State diagram with clearly labeled states and transitions
- Detailed description of each state
- Documentation of transition triggers and conditions
- Notation for default/initial states

#### Example State Transition: Order Processing
**States**:
- Draft: Initial order creation
- Pending: Order submitted but not approved
- Approved: Order approved but not fulfilled
- In Progress: Order is being fulfilled
- Completed: Order fulfillment finished
- Cancelled: Order process terminated

**Transitions**:
- Draft → Pending: User submits order
- Pending → Approved: Supervisor approves
- Pending → Cancelled: User or supervisor cancels
- Approved → In Progress: Fulfillment team begins work
- In Progress → Completed: All items fulfilled
- Any State → Cancelled: User with permission cancels

---

### 3.5 User Scenarios

User scenarios provide narrative descriptions of specific user goals and the ideal paths to achieving them, contextualizing flows within real-world situations.

#### Components
- **Persona**: The user in the scenario
- **Context**: Situational background
- **Goal**: What the user aims to accomplish
- **Motivation**: Why this goal matters to the user
- **Success Criteria**: How the user knows they've succeeded

#### Documentation Format
Scenarios should be documented as:
- Narrative descriptions (1-2 paragraphs)
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Linked to relevant flows and wireframes

#### Example Scenario: Emergency Access to Patient Records
**Persona**: Dr. James Wilson, Emergency Department Physician  
**Context**: Friday night in a busy emergency department  
**Goal**: Quickly access critical medical history for an unconscious patient  
**Motivation**: Needs to make rapid treatment decisions with incomplete information  

**Scenario**:  
An unconscious patient arrives in the emergency department with no identification. Dr. Wilson needs to quickly determine if the patient has any existing records in the system that might inform treatment decisions. Using the emergency search function, he enters the physical characteristics of the patient and partial information from a medical alert bracelet. The system returns potential matches, prioritizing patients with critical conditions or allergies. Dr. Wilson identifies a likely match and can immediately see critical information (allergies, current medications, major conditions) without needing to navigate through the full record.

**Success Criteria**:  
- Critical patient information identified within 60 seconds
- Confidence in patient identity established
- Key medical history factors incorporated into treatment decision

---

### 3.6 Task Flows

Task flows document the specific sequence of steps required to complete a discrete task within the system, focusing on efficiency and clarity.

#### Components
- **Task objective**: The specific outcome the user wants to achieve
- **Preconditions**: What must be true before starting the task
- **Steps**: Sequential actions to complete the task
- **Decision points**: Where the flow may branch
- **Postconditions**: What is true after task completion

#### Documentation Format
- Numbered step-by-step sequence
- Annotated screenshots or wireframes
- Estimated time to complete
- Frequency of use indicator

#### Example Task Flow: Scheduling a Follow-up Appointment
**Objective**: Schedule a follow-up appointment for a patient  
**Preconditions**: Patient record is open, user has scheduling permissions  
**Frequency**: Very High (>20 times/day per provider)  
**Estimated Time**: 30 seconds

**Steps**:
1. Click "Schedule" button in patient record header
2. Select appointment type "Follow-up" from dropdown
3. Choose department/provider from available options
4. Select available time slot from calendar view
5. Add any special instructions in notes field (optional)
6. Click "Confirm Appointment"
7. System displays confirmation with appointment details
8. Click "Send Notification" to alert patient (optional)

**Postconditions**:
- Appointment is created in scheduling system
- Appointment appears in provider's calendar
- Patient record is updated with appointment information
- Notification is sent to patient (if selected)
