1. **README File**
   - Describe the project purpose, installation steps, and usage instructions.
   
2. **Contribution Guidelines**
   - Provide detailed instructions for contributing to the project.
   - Include coding style, branching strategy, and testing requirements.

3. **Code of Conduct**
   - Set expectations for contributors' behavior.
